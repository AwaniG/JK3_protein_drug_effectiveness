        "We want to install NVIDIA's Apex tool, for the training pipeline used by `simple-transformers` and Weights and Biases. This package enables us to use 16-bit training, mixed precision, and distributed training without any changes to our code. Generally GPUs are good at doing 32-bit(single precision) math, not at 16-bit(half) nor 64-bit(double precision). Therefore traditionally deep learning model trainings are done in 32-bit. By switching to 16-bit, we’ll be using half the memory and theoretically less computation at the expense of the available number range and precision. However, pure 16-bit training creates a lot of problems for us (imprecise weight updates, gradient underflow and overflow). **Mixed precision training, with Apex, alleviates these problems**.\n",
