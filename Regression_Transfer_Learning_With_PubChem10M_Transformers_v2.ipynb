This package enables us to use 16-bit training, mixed precision, and distributed training without any changes to our code. Generally GPUs are good at doing 32-bit(single precision) math, not at 16-bit(half) nor 64-bit(double precision). Therefore traditionally deep learning model trainings are done in 32-bit. By switching to 16-bit, we’ll be using half the memory and theoretically less computation at the expense of the available number range and precision. However, pure 16-bit training creates a lot of problems for us (imprecise weight updates, gradient underflow and overflow). **Mixed precision training, with Apex, alleviates these problems**.\n","\n","We will be installing `simple-transformers`, a library which builds ontop of HuggingFace's `transformers` package specifically for fine-tuning ChemBERTa."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"VjDBOn0Wmybe","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1697139354172,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":43213,"user":{"displayName":"Sindhu Ghanta","userId":"16580835592664646115"}},"outputId":"fbc250c7-490b-4570-d09d-8a3dac7fdd98"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Cloning into 'apex'...\n","remote: Enumerating objects: 11356, done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Counting objects: 100% (3493/3493), done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Compressing objects: 100% (416/416), done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Total 11356 (delta 3225), reused 3138 (delta 3077), pack-reused 7863\u001b[K\n","Receiving objects: 100% (11356/11356), 15.36 MiB | 31.03 MiB/s, done.\n","Resolving deltas: 100% (7984/7984), done.\n","Using pip 23.1.2 from /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pip (python 3.10)\n","Processing ./apex\n","  Running command pip subprocess to install build dependencies\n","  Using pip 23.1.2 from /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pip (python 3.10)\n","  Collecting setuptools\n","    Downloading setuptools-68.2.2-py3-none-any.whl (807 kB)\n","       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 807.9/807.9 kB 12.9 MB/s eta 0:00:00\n","  Collecting wheel\n","    Downloading wheel-0.41.2-py3-none-any.whl (64 kB)\n","       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 64.8/64.8 kB 4.1 MB/s eta 0:00:00\n","  Installing collected packages: wheel, setuptools\n","    Creating /tmp/pip-build-env-8ivdbka1/overlay/local/bin\n","    changing mode of /tmp/pip-build-env-8ivdbka1/overlay/local/bin/wheel to 755\n","  ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.
